1. **Compare the heights of the resultant trees â€“ how do they compare with a Binary Search Tree (BST) for the same input values?**

The heights of the resultant trees are smaller than the height of the binary search trees. Due to the fact
a binary search tree is NOT self-balancing - there may be certain instances where the tree is more left/right dominant.
This leads to increase hight of the tree. Red-Black, 2-3-4 and B trees are all self-balancing, meaning nodes may
split, expand and replace each other. This means the trees will always balance to a height height of (log n).
Note that binary search trees can be (log n) height, but falter in worst-case scenarios.



2. **Compare the complexity of the algorithms, how much work would be required for the main operations: insert | find | delete? Compare this to BST.**
    * The insert, find and delete time complexity for a Binary Search tree has a worst case scenario of `O(h)`
      (h is the height of the tree), because of the binary splitting of levels generally a BST can run in `O(log n)` time.
      One potential disadvantage of this is that a BST can degrade over time into a degenerate tree, reducing search time to `O(n)`

    * A red-black tree shares the same time complexity of `O(log n)` for insert, find and delete

3. **Compare the understandability of the algorithms, which would be easier to implement?**
    * 2-3-4 Trees and Red-Black trees are equivalent data structures, how ever 2-3-4 trees can
      involve more complex node splits and expansions compared to Red-Blacks Trees, making them harder to implement

    * B trees are not as complex as 2-3-4 trees but not as simple as red-black trees.
      They are much simpler in terms of traversal as keys are stored in a sequential sorted order. 
      This is especially useful for storing database and hard-drive data.

4. **Describe how an in-order traversal would work on each type of tree.**

Red-Black, 2-3-4 and B Trees allow for efficient in-order traversal just like any ordinary binary search tree.
A recursive method can be used that searches starting from the left most leaf node, and traversing all sub trees, and will 
finish once the right side sub tree is explored.

# Recap
Binary Search Trees run in O(log n) time. ( fast )
They can degrade to O(n) "linear time", depending on the data. ( slow down )
Eg: input of [12,13,14,17] will degrade a BST as they stack on the right, as elements are increasing in value.
- To traverse to '14' it will take n(3) aka the height of '14' in the tree.
- This is called a degenerate tree.
- But we want a balanced/complete/semi-complete tree.

# Red-Black Trees

# 2-3-4 Trees
- Each node can store 1,2 or 3 entries
- Number of children is equal to number of entries + 1, else its zero
